## 🍽️ Restaurant Table Booking and Billing System
# 📌 Project Overview

The Restaurant Table Booking and Billing System is a menu-driven Python application developed to manage restaurant operations such as table booking, order placement, bill generation and table availability tracking.
The project demonstrates the use of Python Object-Oriented Programming, exception handling and structured data storage to simulate real-world restaurant workflows.
This project was developed as an Individual Project during Semester 3 for academic learning.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Exception Handling
- Data Structures (Dictionary, Set)

# ✨ Features

- Book tables for customers
- Display restaurant menus
- Place food orders
- Generate bills based on orders
- Free tables after billing
- Show available/free tables
- Support for multiple restaurants with different menus

# 🧩 Project Structure

The project is organized using a main Restaurant class, which includes:

- Table booking functionality
- Order placement logic
- Bill generation logic
- Table availability management
- Menu display

Multiple restaurant instances are created, each with its own menu and table configuration.

# 🧠 Implementation Details

- Uses dictionaries to store table details and orders
- Uses sets to track available/free tables
- Applies exception handling for invalid inputs
- Implements menu-driven interaction using user input
- Follows clean and modular OOP design

# ▶️ How to Run the Project

git clone <repository-link>

2. Open the project in any Python IDE or terminal.
3. Run the Python file:
    python main.py
4. Follow the on-screen menu to perform operations.
